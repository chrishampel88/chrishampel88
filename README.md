I present my first job, a recipe SPA

Good morning everyone!!!! I wanted to share with you my individual project that I did for #soyhenry. A recipe app consuming data from an api (spoonacular) in which we can search for recipes and filter them by name or ranking, we will also be able to create our own recipes and save them in the database

made with #react, #redux, #css , #postgresql , #express ,#sequelize, #nodejs


Hope you like!
